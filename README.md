# EduManage
📌 Problem Statement
Many schools still rely on fragmented or manual systems to manage academic operations. Handling students, teachers, classes, attendance, and access control across multiple tools leads to inefficiency, data inconsistency, and security risks.
EduManage aims to provide a centralized, secure, and role-based platform that simplifies school administration and improves data accessibility for all stakeholders.


#Stakeholders

#Core Requirements

Secure Authentication System using JWT and cookies

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict features based on user roles
